# Untitled PSX-style horror puzzle game
### A proof-of-concept for rendering a PSX-style horror game, with on-the-fly generated pre-rendered backgrounds
- In the style of Resident Evil or old PC point-and-click adventures, but using modern rasterization to generate the backgrounds on scene transition
- Allowing for rapid development of complicated scenes, rendered with more fidelity than a phone or older computer could keep up with in real-time
Unity 2019.2.6f1
